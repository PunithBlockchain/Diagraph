# DiaGraph  
**A Decentralized AI Knowledge Hub for Diabetes**

---

## 🌟 Overview  
DiaGraph is an open-source, decentralized application (dApp) built to unite diabetes-related research, clinical insights, and patient‐reported data into one continuously evolving knowledge graph. By leveraging automated “BioAgents” for data ingestion, a graph database for structured storage, and a blockchain layer for verifiable provenance, DiaGraph helps researchers, clinicians, and patient communities:

- **Discover** connections among genes, biomarkers, drugs, and clinical outcomes.  
- **Trust** that every update (new abstract, patient metric, co‐occurrence link) is cryptographically anchored.  
- **Explore** a unified graph via simple web APIs or a user‐friendly interface—no deep database or programming skills required.  

Whether your goal is to identify which biomarkers co‐occur with a particular complication, verify that a dataset was used in a given analysis, or empower non‐technical users to navigate complex literature, DiaGraph makes it effortless.

## 📂 High-Level Structure

- **BioAgents Layer**  
  Handles automated retrieval and processing of biomedical content (e.g., PubMed abstracts, pre‐trained NER models), providing standardized, API‐driven data outputs.

- **Graph Storage**  
  A graph database holds all entities (genes, chemicals, diseases, patient cohorts, trials) and the relationships among them. Every abstract, entity, and co‐occurrence link becomes a part of this interconnected map.

- **Blockchain Provenance**  
  Once new data is ingested and the graph is updated, DiaGraph computes a content fingerprint (“graph hash”) and records it on a public blockchain. This ensures that anyone can verify exactly which snapshot of information was used at any point in time.

- **API Layer**  
  A straightforward set of web endpoints (e.g., “list all entities,” “show co‐occurrence neighbors,” “retrieve details for a given paper”) lets users and applications query the graph without needing specialized software or complex database queries.

- **User Interface (Optional)**  
  A web‐based front end (built with modern UI frameworks) allows interactive exploration: type a keyword, view all related entities, and see how they connect at a glance. Non‐technical users can click through nodes, filter by category (gene, drug, disease), and visually navigate the network.

## ✨ Key Benefits

1. **Unified, AI‐Driven Insights**  
   - DiaGraph automatically gathers thousands of diabetes‐related abstracts, extracts key concepts (e.g., genes, proteins, medications), and links them in a single, searchable graph.  
   - Manual cross‐referencing of dozens of papers becomes unnecessary—everything is already connected and updated.

2. **Trustworthy Provenance**  
   - Every time the database grows, an immutable “graph hash” is stored on a public blockchain.  
   - Researchers and clinicians can confirm that the data they see matches exactly what was published or analyzed in a given study, preventing ambiguity or version drift.

3. **Lower Barrier for Non‐Technical Users**  
   - Clinicians, patient advocates, and others without coding expertise can issue simple web requests (or use a point‐and‐click interface) to explore relationships—no SQL, no graph query language needed.  
   - Common queries like “Which chemicals co‐occur with ‘inflammation’?” or “Show all genes mentioned in PMID 12345678” are a click away.

4. **Collaborative, Community‐Driven**  
   - Patients or research groups can contribute de‐identified metrics (e.g., HbA₁c values, glucose logs) through a secure portal.  
   - Each contribution is recorded on-chain, guaranteeing data integrity and offering transparency around who contributed what and when.

5. **Extensible & Future-Proof**  
   - Although the initial focus is diabetes, the same architecture—automated biomedical ingestion, graph storage, on-chain verification—can be adapted to other disease areas with minimal changes.  
   - As new methods (e.g., more advanced AI models or richer patient data sources) emerge, DiaGraph’s modular design makes it easy to plug in additional components.

## 🌱 Who Can Use DiaGraph?

- **Biomedical Researchers**  
  Quickly locate co‐occurrence patterns across abstracts, discover non‐obvious links (e.g., a drug that repeatedly appears alongside a genetic marker), and generate new hypotheses without manual data wrangling.

- **Clinicians & Patient Advocates**  
  Navigate a living network of diabetes knowledge—explore which biomarkers relate to specific complications, see associated clinical trials, or find patient‐reported outcome trends, all through a user‐friendly interface.

- **Data Contributors**  
  Upload de‐identified patient metrics or new publications, knowing that each addition is cryptographically anchored and can be independently verified by anyone.

- **Students & Educators**  
  Use DiaGraph as a teaching tool to illustrate how AI, graph technologies, and decentralized provenance can come together to accelerate translational research.

## 🚀 How DiaGraph Works (At a Glance)

1. **Automated Data Collection**  
   - A specialized “PubMedAgent” fetches recent diabetes‐related abstracts.  
   - A “NERAgent” scans each abstract, extracting mention of genes, diseases, chemicals, biomarkers, and more.

2. **Graph Construction**  
   - Each abstract becomes a node; each extracted entity becomes a node; a “mentions” link connects entity → abstract.  
   - Whenever two entities appear in the same abstract, a “co‐occurrence” relationship is created between them.

3. **On-Chain Anchoring**  
   - After the graph is updated, DiaGraph computes a fingerprint of all stored data.  
   - That fingerprint is published to a public blockchain, ensuring a verifiable record of exactly which data snapshot is in use.

4. **Query Interface**  
   - RESTful endpoints let users ask for lists of entities by type (e.g., all chemicals, all diseases).  
   - Users can request “neighbors” of a given entity (co-occurring entities), or all entities and relationships associated with a specific PubMed ID.

5. **Visualization & Exploration** (Optional)  
   - A simple web front end allows drag-and-drop graph exploration. Click a node to see details, filter by category, and pan/zoom across the diabetes knowledge network.

## 🎯 The Problems DiaGraph Addresses

1. **Fragmentation of Diabetes Information**  
   - Research, clinical trials, genetics, and patient data live in separate silos.  
   - DiaGraph unifies these disparate sources into one continuously evolving graph.

2. **Hidden Connections**  
   - Manually discovering co-occurrence of a gene, biomarker, and lifestyle factor across multiple papers can take weeks.  
   - DiaGraph surfaces these links instantly—no manual cross‐checking required.

3. **Lack of Verifiable Provenance**  
   - How do you know that two researchers used the exact same dataset when their analyses produce different results?  
   - DiaGraph’s on-chain hashes guarantee that every snapshot of the graph (and its underlying data) can be independently verified.

4. **Technical Barriers for Non-Coders**  
   - Clinicians, students, and patient groups often lack the database or programming skills to navigate raw literature datasets.  
   - DiaGraph’s web APIs and optional visual interface remove those barriers, letting anyone explore complex relationships with simple clicks or HTTP calls.

5. **Trust & Incentives for Collaboration**  
   - Patient contributions (de‐identified metrics, CGM readings) carry natural privacy concerns, and institutions want proof that their data is used responsibly.  
   - DiaGraph’s blockchain layer builds trust, and future versions can introduce token incentives to reward high-quality, verified data contributions.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- DiaGraph transforms **hundreds or thousands of scattered abstracts** into a **single, living network** of diabetes knowledge.  
- By anchoring each update on a public blockchain, every user can trust and verify the exact data that fuels their queries and analyses.  
- Designed for **flexibility**, DiaGraph can evolve from a research prototype into a community‐driven resource, empowering anyone—from bench scientists to patient advocates—to uncover new insights and accelerate diabetes research.
